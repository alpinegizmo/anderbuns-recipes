#### Step 1

Bloom the coriander seeds and cardamom, then add the onion and cook until it starts to brown. Then add the garlic and ginger, after a minute, start adding the spinach. (I often use frozen spinach, whihch works fine.)

#### Step 2

Once the spinach is wilted (or melted), remove from the heat and add the chile and lime juice, and season with salt.

Blitz the mixture in your food processor or blender, and then return it to the pan on the stove. Add water as needed (maybe ½ cup), and add pleasing chunks of feta (try to keep them intact).

Cook for a few minutes until the feta has gotten soft and and bit gloopy.

#### Step 3

Make a _chonk_ with the cumin seeds and powdered chili, and pour it over the spinach mixture.
