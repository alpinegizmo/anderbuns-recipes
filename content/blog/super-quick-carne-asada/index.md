steps:

- "The meat we use from our butcher is cut pretty thin, so depending on the thickness of your meat cut you may want to adjust this time."
- "Remove the steak from the skillet and squeeze lime over your cooked meat to taste."
- "If you’re using this for carne asada fries, cut the steak into little pieces and add over fries with shredded cheese (Mexican blend), sour cream, guacamole and hot sauce."
- "Enjoy!"

#### Step 1
Place a skillet over your burner on medium low.

#### Step 2

While the skillet is heating, conservatively sprinkle the salt, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder on one side of a steak. I typically just sprinkle straight from the spice containers and evenly distribute it over the meat.

#### Step 3

Once the grill is hot, place the seasoned side of the meat down on the skillet. Then, sprinkle the salt, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder on the unseasonsed side.

#### Step 4
After about 2-3 minutes, you'll see the top of the meat start to get juicy—that's when you'll want to flip the meat and cook for another 2-3 minutes.

*The meat we use from our butcher is cut pretty thin, so depending on the thickness of your meat cut you may want to adjust this time.*

#### Step 5

Remove the steak from the skillet and squeeze lime over your cooked meat to taste.

#### Step 6

If you're using this for carne asada fries, cut the steak into little pieces and add over fries with shredded cheese (Mexican blend), sour cream, guacamole and hot sauce.

#### Last Step!

Enjoy!
