This ridiculously easy, and so good!

I learned about charring vegetables from [Carla Lalli Music at bon app√©tit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgqP6MF-y9Y), but I don't think her's is the best example of how to make this particular dish.

I find it works best to choose a cabbage that it is somewhat loosely constructed, and cut it into 4-6 wedges, depending on its size. Don't remove the core &mdash; you want to keep it so that the wedges remain intact.

I use a mixture of oil and butter, and turn the wedges over once they are nicely charred on one side. You can baste the cabbage as it cooks with the hot oil/butter mixture.

Haven't tried this yet with the vinegar, fish sauce, and tarragon (from the video below), but I like the idea very much. I have tried fresh basil, and that was good.
