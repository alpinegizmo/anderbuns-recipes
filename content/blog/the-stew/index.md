Variation: I think this would be really good with some cauliflower added to it.

#### Step 1: 3-5 minutes

In a large pot, heat the oil and then add the onion, garlic, and ginger. You can peel the ginger with a spoon, but no one will notice if you don't bother. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the onion begins to brown a little.

#### Step 2: 8-10 minutes

Add the turmeric, red-pepper flakes, and chickpeas. Season again with salt and pepper. Stir frequently, so that the chickpeas fry in the oil and spices. You want them to eventually break down (in the next step), but for now, let them get a bit crispy.

#### Step 3: 30 minutes

Crush the chickpeas. Add the coconut milk and stock (or water), and season again with salt and pepper. Let it simmer.

#### Step 4: a few minutes

Add the greens, wait for them to wilt and soften, which won't take long.

#### Step 5: you're done!
