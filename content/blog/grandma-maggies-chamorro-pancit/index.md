steps:
- "If you’re starting with raw chicken, season with salt and pepper and grill for 7-8 minutes on both sides. Let cool before shredding. Tip: We’ll usually just start with leftover cooked chicken or store-bought rotisserie chicken for this recipe (I know, kinda cheating)."
- "Soak noodles in warm water (but not hot water) and set aside."
- "Heat 1 ½ cups of chicken broth in the microwave for one (1) minute."
- "Remove broth from microwave, add the ahciote powder and stir until fully mixed. You should get a nice red color."
- "Slice green onions and garlic."
- "In a large wok or pot over medium heat, add the olive oil and butter."
- "When the butter is melted, add the garlic and the about half of the green onions (we’ll add the rest later). Cook until garlic is translucent."
- "Add the achiote-broth mixture to the wok/pot."
- "Once the broth is hot, add the chicken and stir to completely coat the chicken with the achiote-broth mixture."
- "Discard the water that the noodles are soaking in and add noodles to the wok. Stir constantly to get a good color on the noodles."
- "Add salt and pepper to taste. Top with rest of green onions."
- "Enjoy!"
