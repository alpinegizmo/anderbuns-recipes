* Preheat oven to 400°F / 200°C.

* Pour boiling water over the bran flakes and let stand while mixing other ingredients. 

* Cream butter and sugar. 

* Add eggs and buttermilk.

* Add Bran Buds and soggy bran flakes, then gradually add in flour, salt, and baking soda. Mix well.

* Either use a silicone rubber muffin tray, or paper cups (or both). If you use the bare rubber tray, it's still a good idea to lightly grease the cups. Fill the cups about 2/3 full.

* Bake at 400°F for 16-18 minutes.
