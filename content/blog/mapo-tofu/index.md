See the video description for directions. 

The mushrooms supply the essential umami that this dish requires (it's normally very meaty), so make sure you do justice by the mushrooms.

I've indicated in my notes where I deviated from the original ingredients, either out of necessity, or fear. The result was really good, and near the edge of our comfort zone (heatwise).

The original suggests substituting black peppercorns for Sichuan peppercorns, if you must. That would be sad.
