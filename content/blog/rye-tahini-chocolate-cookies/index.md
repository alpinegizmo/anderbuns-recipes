Based on the recipes from [Green Kitchen Stories](https://greenkitchenstories.com/tahini-rye-cookies/) and [The Boy Who Bakes](https://www.theboywhobakes.co.uk/recipes/2019/3/7/tahini-and-rye-chocolate-chip-cookies-inspired-by-mokonuts-in-paris).

#### Step 1

Combine the flours, baking powder, and salt.

#### Step 2

Mix the butter, tahini, sugar, and dates (if desired) in a food processor until light and fluffy.

#### Step 3

Add the eggs (in the food processor).

#### Step 4

Mix the wet into the dry, add the chocolate.

#### Step 5

Refrigerate until firm (~2 hours).

#### Step 6

Preheat oven to 190°C / 380°F, or a bit cooler (170°C) with the fan. (Yes, this is a bit hotter than normal for cookies.)

Roll dough into balls, and coat them with sesame seeds.

Bake for 10-11 minutes.

After they’ve been in the oven for 6-7 minutes, remove the tray from the oven and smack it against the countertop a few times to help the cookies flatten out a bit.

Bake until slightly browned.
