Original recipe.

#### Step 1

Parboil the broccoli rabe (2-ish minutes). This step is important for removing the bitterness.

#### Step 2

Squeeze the water out of the rabe and dry very well (paper towels or cloth napkins work well). This step is important for getting the rabe crispy when broiled.

#### Step 3

Roughly grind/crush the cumin and Sichuan peppercorns with mortar and pestle. Combine with other ingredients and coat the rabe well. (Note: we often do this in a gallon sized ziploc bag and shake.)

#### Step 4

Spread out the rabe in a single layer on the broiling tray/baking sheet. (You can use a layer of foil to reduce cleanup.) Broil until crispy and somewhat blackened (several minutes).
