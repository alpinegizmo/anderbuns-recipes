The fresh ingredients are optional, but desirable.

#### Step 1

Get the water and then the spaghetti going while working on the sauce.

#### Step 2

If you want to go the extra mile, grill a red pepper and a zucchini. 

#### Step 3

Heat up the sardines and sauce, adding some pitted olives (if you want), and the grilled veggies (if you decide to bother). Crop up a generous bunch of parsley and add it in toward the end, if you have some.
