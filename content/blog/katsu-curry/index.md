I diverge from this recipe in the following ways:

- Saute some mushrooms along with the onion.
- Don't bother with the chicken stock or the cornstarch paste.
- Substitute fried tofu and steamed broccoli for the fried chicken.
- Don't bother blitzing the curry sauce.

#### Step 1: 5-6 minutes on low-medium heat

Saute the onion in the oil until browned a bit on the edges. 

#### Step 2: Add spices and liquid

Add bay leaves, curry powder, turmeric, but not the garam masala.

Turn up the heat to medium or medium high.

Add the coconut milk gradually, letting it come up to a boil each time before adding more.

#### Step 3: Simmer for 15-20 minutes, prepare add-ins

Add water and bouillon/MSG (or better, use some stock) as needed to keep it from getting too thick.

Meanwhile, prepare the broccoli and tofu.

#### Step 4: Season

Remove the bay leaves, and add the salt, soy sauce, sugar, and garam masala.

#### Step 5: Add the broccoli and tofu

Add the broccoli and tofu, then wait at least until the veggies and protein are heated through. Giving it more time will help the flavors meld together.
