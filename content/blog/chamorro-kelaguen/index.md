steps:
- "If you’re starting with raw chicken, season with salt and pepper and grill for 7-8 minutes on both sides. Let cool before shredding. Tip: We’ll usually just start with leftover cooked chicken or store-bought rotisserie chicken for this recipe (I know, kinda cheating)."
- "Take your cooked chicken and cut into little cubes. Add to a large mixing bowl."
- "Add the the green onions, grated coconut, sliced pepper and lemon juice and mix well."
- "This dish is traditionally served cold, so after you’ve mixed it, refrigerate for a couple hours."
- "Serve over rice, pita bread or corn tortillas."
- "Enjoy!"
