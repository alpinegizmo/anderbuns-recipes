If you make some extra rice for dinner the night before, then this comes together quickly. Otherwise, start the rice while you put together the rest of the batter, and then add the rice once it's ready.

If the rice is hot, be careful not to add the eggs directly to the hot rice, or you risk cooking the eggs prematurely (in the mixing bowl). Better to first mix the dry ingredients, then whisk in the oil, milk, and eggs, and finally the rice. _Don't forget the cardamom!_

These waffles don't need any baking powder or other leavening.

You can use a belgian waffle maker, but we prefer the texture that results from using a more traditional waffle iron (the thinner waffles have more surface area).
