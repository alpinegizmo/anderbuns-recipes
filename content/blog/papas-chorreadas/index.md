This is one of those meals where you can get away with starting the cooking while you finish the prep.

#### Step 1

Peel the potatoes, or not. Get them going in the microwave while you prep the green beans. Or steam the potatoes on the stove until just barely done. 

#### Step 2

Sauté the onion in the olive oil until tender, then add the garlic, green onions, chili, and aromatics. (The original recipe calls for butter rather than olive oil. Ehh.)

#### Step 3

Add the tomatoes and salt, and give everything a nice stir from time to time.

#### Step 4

At some point the potatoes will be done, and you can switch to steaming the green beans in the microwave (if you didn't steam both veggies on the stove). 

Add the potatoes and green beans to the skillet as they become ready. Mash the potatoes into the mixture, get it nice and smooshy.

Let everything cook together for 5-10 minutes.

#### Step 5

If you want the creamy goopiness, add it just before serving.
