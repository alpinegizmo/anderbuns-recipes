steps:
- "Turn your oven broiler on high. Wrap a baking sheet in foil."
- "Place your flank steak on the baking sheet to season. Brush steak with olive oil on both sides. Rub one (1) teaspoon each of sea salt, ground pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to each side."
- "Cook in oven broiler to your desired temperature. We usually cook for 8-10 minutes on each side."
- "Remove from oven broiler and let the steak rest on a cutting board for at least 5 minutes before cutting."
- "Add oregano, red pepper flakes, olive oil, red wine vinegar and lemon juice to the bowl."
- "With an immersion hand blender, blend all the ingredients till you get a nice liquidy texture—should be similar to a salad dressing."
- "Add salt to taste."
- "Cut the flank steak against the grain into your desired thickness. If you want to get fancy, you can cut at a 45-degree angle. This looks great and also helps break up the fiber on the steak—creating a more tender cut."
- "Place meat over your favorite salad mix (we like sweet kale salad for this recipe) and a little brown rice. Pour over chimichurri salad dressing."
- "Enjoy!"
