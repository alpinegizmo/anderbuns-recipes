#### Step 1

* Cover the bottom of a shallow 9-inch square microwave-safe baking dish with 1 T olive oil, 1 T lemon juice
* Arrange a layer of sliced/chunked tomatoes, covered liberally with basil
* Season with black pepper and salt to taste
* Put in salmon, skin side up (if there's skin)
* Cover dish with lid or plastic film 
* Microwave for 2.5 minutes on high

#### Step 2

* Take dish out and remove skin from salmon (if it has skin)
* Turn salmon upside down and use a spoon to pull up some (not all) of the tomato-lemon juice-oil-etc. mixture to cover the salmon (it doesn't matter if the salmon skin has scales, but if it does, remove the skin and scales before turning the fish over; you don't want the scales to get into the sauce in the bottom of the dish)
* Recover with the lid or plastic wrap and cook until just done all the way through; perhaps another 2 minutes (or 3 minutes for thick filets)
* Let sit for 2-3 minutes before uncovering

#### Step 3

* Serve with/on spaghetti or rice
* Garnish as desired with fresh basil leaves (“Italian direction”) or with spicy chili sauce (“Asian direction”)

#### Variant

For the Asian direction, it's possible to keep the scale-less skin on and then after the initial 2.5 minutes in the microwave, put it under the broiler to crisp up the skin. (Could bake in oven, I suppose, using foil to cover, but I haven't done that and so have no clue how long it would take.)
