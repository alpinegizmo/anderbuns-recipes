This is [Mark Bittman's recipe from the New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013121-pad-thai). I've tried others; this one is easier, and I've never messed it up.

#### Step 1: Start noodles

Cover noodles with boiling water, let them sit until barely tender. Drain, and put some peanut oil on them to keep them from sticking together. Set them aside until ready to add at the end.

#### Step 2: Make sauce

Meanwhile, cook together the tamarind paste, fish sauce (unless vegan), honey, and vinegar in a small saucepan. Bring it to a simmer, check the flavor. Maybe add more tamarind paste, but don't make it too sour. Stir in red pepper flakes and turn off the heat.

#### Step 3: Stir fry the main ingredients

Heat up 3 Tbsp of peanut oil in a large skillet or wok (medium-high heat), then add scallions and garlic. After a minute add the eggs; once they start to set, scramble then until barely done. Add cabbage and sprouts, then protein(s). 

#### Step 4: Put it all together

Add the drained noodles and the sauce to the pan, heat the noodles through and serve with peanuts, cilantro, and lime wedges.
