Preheat the oven (see the temperature details below).

#### Step 1

Make the pie dough, using [Lynn's pie crust recipe](../pie-crust/). Roll out the bottom crust and put it in the pie dish. 

#### Step 2

Peel the apples and slice them relatively thin. 

#### Step 3

Put the flour, brown sugar, and a bunch of cinnamon and some nutmeg onto the apples and toss it all around until the apples are well coated. Arrange the apples in a heap on top of the pie crust in the pie dish. (If you use really big apples, you may want to stack the apples fairly carefully to fit them all in.) 

#### Step 4

Roll out the other crust and cover the mound of apples. You can get fancy-schmancy with the top crust if you wish, of course, so long as you make sure there are a few vent holes in the top crust. (For a plain top crust, just prick it a few times with a fork in a few different places.)

#### Step 5

If using a metal pie plate, put in oven preheated to 450ºF (230ºC) and bake for about 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 350ºF (175ºC) and bake for another 40-45 minutes. (If you're using a glass dish, you should reduce the initial temp to 425ºF (215ºC), but 350ºF is fine for both thereafter.)

> David: "How do you know when the pie is done?"<br>Lynn: "You just have to take it on faith that after 55-60 minutes an apple pie will be done. If you go too long the filling will turn into applesauce. Which isn't necessarily a problem."
