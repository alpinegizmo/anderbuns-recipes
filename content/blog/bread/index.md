The internet is full of recipes for no-knead bread. [This one from jocooks.com](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/no-knead-bread/) is another good starting point, but doesn't include a second rise, which is something you want. [What does the second rise do?](https://www.chowhound.com/post/knead-bread-rise-344524?page=2)

The reasoning behind no-knead bread is:

* By using very little yeast, a lot of water, and a long rising time, you're getting a lot of fermentation and gluten development (that otherwise requires kneading).

* By baking it in a closed dutch oven, all that water in the dough is creating steam, which mimicks the steam ovens that bakers use.

I've found these factors are helpful in getting good results:

* During the initial mixing, be sure to be thorough. It's not that you have to work the dough, but any flour that doesn't get wet now will become a regret later on. You can just leave it in the bowl you mixed it in, covered with plastic wrap.

* Don't skimp on the rising time. Plan on 16-18 hours for the first rise.

* Before you turn on the oven, take the dough and do a few stretch/fold maneuvers (and don't worry if it's a shaggy blob). This involves stretching the dough out in one dimension, enough to then fold it over in thirds. Then rotate 90°, and repeat. Do about four of these stretches and folds, and then shape and pinch the blob into a loaf as best you can, putting the seam down onto parchment paper. Cover again and let it rest for about two hours. I've found covering it with a towel makes a mess, so I suggest transfering it back into the mixing bowl.

* With both of these rises, it's not really about waiting for a preset about of time, but rather waiting until the dough has reached the right stage of readiness. You'll learn to recognize this.

* Pre-heat the oven to 450°F (around 230°C), with the dutch oven in the oven (which is why you didn't put the shaggy blob into the dutch oven earlier -- you'd rather not have to move it an extra time). You can start this about 30 minutes before the second rise is done, as it will take your oven a while to heat up. (Part of what's happening during this second rise is that the blob is developing a tougher "skin" that will hold the loaf together, and allow the gas inside to expand, while holding it in.)

* When it's time to bake, you'll have to _carefully_ take the hot dutch oven out of the oven.

* You can use the parchment paper to lift the proto-loaf and ferry it into the dutch oven like a helicopter. But you'll probably want to reshape it somewhat first.

* When you take the lid off after the first 30 minutes of baking, you can remove the parchment paper, if you want.

* Slash the loaf with a knife before baking. This isn't just about making it pretty &mdash; it reduces the surface tension of the loaf, and helps it open up while baking.
