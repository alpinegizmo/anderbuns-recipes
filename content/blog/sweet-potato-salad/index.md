From [Roasted Sweet Potato Salad With Black Beans and Chile Dressing](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012795-roasted-sweet-potato-salad-with-black-beans-and-chile-dressing) in the New York Times.

#### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F / 200°C.

Coat sweet potatoes and onion with 2 Tbsp of oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 30-40 minutes. You can also roast the bell pepper if you want, but leaving it raw gives a nice contrast.

_For a quick version you can microwave the sweet potatoes and use the onion raw, but less of it._

#### Step 2

Use a blender or small food processor to combine the chilies, garlic, lime juice, remaining olive oil, and a bit of salt and pepper.

_Or, smoosh the garlic, mince the chiles, and combine with the other ingredients in a small bowl._

#### Step 3

Toss everything together in a large bowl. Don't forget the beans, bell pepper, and cilantro. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.
