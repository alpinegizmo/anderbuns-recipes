Notes:

* Rather than frying (crisping up) the chicken breasts and including the fried skin, I included some bacon. It was good, but I imagine the original is better.

* Spinach worked nicely as a substitute for lettuce.

* Toasting the nuts on the stove was worthwhile.

* Lightly pickling the onion was worthwhile too.
