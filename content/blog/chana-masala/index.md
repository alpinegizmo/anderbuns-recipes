From [Vegetarian Indian](https://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Indian-Husain-Shehzad-Hardcover/dp/B011YTS2T6/ref=sr_1_13), by Shehzad Husain, 1995, p. 85.

Lately I've been using 4 tsp of chana masala spice mix instead of the garam masala, chile powder, and pomegranate seeds, plus some additional garam masala for added flavor (about 1 tsp). If your spice mix is fresh, the extra garam masala might not be necessary.

#### Step 1

Combine onions, spices, garlic pulp, salt, and tomato paste in a food processor.

#### Step 2

In a large skillet, briefly saute the garlic cloves and ginger, then add the cumin seeds. After blooming the spices, add the onion mixture.

Stir fry for about 3 minutes, then add the chickpeas. 

#### Step 3

Cook for 5-7 minutes.
