From [Downshiftology: The Best Hummus Recipe](https://downshiftology.com/recipes/3-minute-hummus/). Another good starting point comes from [Love &amp; Lemons](https://www.loveandlemons.com/hummus-recipe/).

#### Step 1: Prepare the chickpeas

Drain the chickpeas, but keep the liquid (which is called aquafaba) for later. Rinse/soak the chickpeas in a large bowl, and squish off and toss the skins of as many as you can without being annoyed. Maybe change the water once or twice while you do this to give them a better rinse.

Removing the skins from the chickpeas yields a creamier, smoother hummus, but is otherwise completely unnecessary.

#### Step 2: Mix everything in a blender or food processor

Dump everything into your blender or food processor and mix it until super smooth. Add as much of the liquid (or water) as needed to reach the desired consistency.
