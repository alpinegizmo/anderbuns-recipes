If you want to take this up a notch, buy a set of dolsot (the traditional stone bowls used for bibimbap) and learn to use them. Ideally a dolsot bibimbap is served sizzling hot, with the rice crispy and stuck to the bowl.

#### Step 1

Prepare some steamed rice.

#### Step 2

Choose your protein and vegetables. Aim for a variety of textures and colors; think about how they will look together in the bowl.

Variation: pickle some thinly sliced radishes in sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. 

#### Step 3

Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl: the gochujang, sesame oil, sugar, vinegar, and garlic. Note: different recipes use different ratios of these ingredients.

#### Step 4

Cook the protein and each of the vegetables, keeping everything separate. Season according to taste.

If you have a very large pan or skillet, you should find it's possible (but tricky) to saut√© several things in it simultaneously, without mixing them. Or you can use more than one pan, or cook things one at a time. If all this separate cooking sounds annoying, then opt for some veggies that don't need to be cooked, or that go really fast, like bean sprouts and pickled radishes. (You could just soak the bean sprouts in some boiling water for 1-2 minutes.)

#### Step 5

Fry the eggs, keeping the yolks runny. (Traditional bibimbap is often served with a raw egg.)

#### Alternative #1

Assemble each bowl: rice first, then arrange the protein and vegetables, and top with a fried egg. 

#### Alternative #2

Assemble everything in a small cast iron skillet, similar to what one would do with the traditional stone bowls, and toast the rice for about 5 minutes.

#### Final step

Top with a generous sprinkling of roasted sesame seeds. 

Variation: Top with a bit of crushed roasted seaweed.
