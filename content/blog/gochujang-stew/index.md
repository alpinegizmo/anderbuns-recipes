I used [this recipe](https://futuredish.com/gochujang-jjigae-use-up-your-tub-of-gochujang) as a starting point, and in the batch shown above, I used chicken thighs, and added some carrot and green beans. In [another, somewhat simpler version](http://crazykoreancooking.com/recipe/red-chili-paste-stew-tuna-chamchi-gochujang-jjigae) they suggest using a can of tuna.

#### Prep

- Cut green onions into small circles.
- Thinly slice the half onion, the potato, the chili pepper, and the mushrooms.
- If using meat, slice it thinly.

#### Cooking

- Stir fry the gochujang in both oils (on low heat). Add the gochugaru and water (or stock). Crank up the heat, and bring it to a boil.

- Add
  - protein
  - potato
  - garlic
  - soy sauce
  - fish sauce

- Boil for 5 minutes, until the potatoes start to soften.

- Add
  - onion
  - mushrooms
  - chili pepper(s) (if desired)

- Cook until the potatoes are done (another 7-10 minutes).

- Add some of the green onion (reserving the rest for a garnish), and finish off with the black pepper.

- Let it rest for 10 minutes, then adjust the seasoning as desired. There's plenty of salt in some of the ingredients, so it shouldn't need any. If anything, you may want to dilute the soup to reduce the saltiness.
