steps:
- "Peel and dice potatoes. Slice onions, carrots and celery to roughly the same size. Garlic can be minced or finely chopped (we're going to blend all this together, so you can leave very coarse)."
- "Add oil in a heavy pot over medium heat."
- "Sauté onions and garlic for 2-3 minutes (until onions are soft). Scrape the bottom of the pot if anything stuck."
- "Add your chosen broth and the rest of the vegetables to the pot. "
- "Cover pot and let simmer for 15 minutes (or until vegetables are really soft)."
- "Turn off the heat and let sit for five (5) minutes to cool a bit."
- "Stir in coconut milk."
- "With an immersion hand blender, carefully blend everything together. We like to set aside some of the cooked potato pieces before we blend so we get some nice chunkey-ness to the soup. Blend until soup is to your desired texture."
- "Stir in sea salt and pepper to taste."
- "Top with chives and bacon. Enjoy!"

#### Step 1
Peel and dice potatoes. Slice onions, carrots and celery to roughly the same size. Garlic can be minced or finely chopped (we're going to blend all this together, so you can leave very coarse).

#### Step 2

Add oil in a heavy pot over medium heat.


#### Step 3

Sauté onions and garlic for 2-3 minutes (until onions are soft).

#### Step 4

Add your chosen broth and the rest of the vegetables to the pot. Scrape the bottom of the pot if anything stuck.

#### Step 5

Cover pot and let simmer for 15 minutes (or until vegetables are really soft).

#### Step 6

Turn off the heat and let sit for five (5) minutes to cool a bit.

#### Step 7

Stir in coconut milk.

#### Step 8

With an [immersion hand blender](https://amzn.to/2uSF4o6), carefully blend everything together. We like to set aside some of the cooked potato pieces before we blend so we get some nice chunkey-ness to the soup. Blend until soup is to your desired texture.

#### Step 9

Stir in sea salt and pepper to taste.

#### Last Step!

Top with chives and bacon. Enjoy!
