Aim for a variety of textures and colors; think about how they will look together in the bowl.</p>\n<p>Variation: pickle some thinly sliced radishes in sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. </p>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<p>Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl. Note: different recipes use different ratios of these ingredients.</p>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<p>Cook the protein and each of the vegetables, keeping everything separate. Season according to taste.</p>\n<p>If you have a very large pan or skillet, you should find it’s possible (but tricky) to sauté several things in it simultaneously, without mixing them. Or you can use more than one pan, or cook things one at a time. If all this separate cooking sounds annoying, then opt for some veggies that don’t need to be cooked, or that go really fast, like bean sprouts and pickled radishes. (You could just soak the bean sprouts in some boiling water for 1-2 minutes.)</p>\n<h4>Step 5</h4>\n<p>Fry the eggs, keeping the yolks runny. (Traditional bibimbap is often served with a raw egg.)</p>\n<h4>Alternative #1</h4>\n<p>Assemble each bowl: rice first, then arrange the protein and vegetables, and top with a fried egg. </p>\n<h4>Alternative #2</h4>\n<p>Assemble everything in a small cast iron skillet, similar to what one would do with the traditional stone bowls, and toast the rice for about 5 minutes.</p>\n<h4>Final step</h4>\n<p>Top with a generous sprinkling of roasted sesame seeds and/or some crushed roasted seaweed, and serve with the sauce on the side.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bibimbap","date":"December 12, 2020","description":"This Korean comfort food is quite forgiving, and less trouble than it looks.","prep":"20 mins","cook":"30 mins","servings":"2","tags":["Main","Korean"],"tools":[{"name":"it's useful to have more than one small pan","note":null}],"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"protein: meat or tofu","note":null},{"ingredient":"julienned carrot, some spinach","note":"enough for 2 people"},{"ingredient":"mushrooms, red pepper, bean sprouts","note":"these are suggestions, use whatever you have"},{"ingredient":"2 eggs","note":null},{"ingredient":"2 servings of cooked rice","note":null}],"sauce":[{"ingredient":"1-2 Tbsp gochujang","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 Tbsp sesame oil","note":null},{"ingredient":"pinch of sugar","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 tsp vinegar","note":"e.g., rice vinegar, apple cider vinegar"},{"ingredient":"1 clove garlic, minced","note":null}],"suggestions":[{"ingredient":"roasted sesame seeds","note":null},{"ingredient":"crushed roasted seaweed","note":null}],"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/0ff54/full.jpg 1200w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/06655/full.jpg 1600w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/5f7bf/full.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bibimbap/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/rice-waffles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Norwegian Rice Waffles"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/pancakes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Buttermilk Pancakes"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
