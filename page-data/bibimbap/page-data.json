Ideally a dolsot bibimbap is served sizzling hot, with the rice crispy and stuck to the bowl.</p>\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<p>Prepare some steamed rice.</p>\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<p>Choose your protein and vegetables. Aim for a variety of textures and colors; think about how they will look together in the bowl. </p>\n<p>Variation: pickle some thinly sliced radishes in sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. </p>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<p>Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl: the gochujang, sesame oil, sugar, vinegar, and garlic. Note: different recipes use different ratios of these ingredients.</p>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<p>Cook the protein and each of the vegetables, keeping everything separate. Season according to taste.</p>\n<h4>Step 5</h4>\n<p>Fry the eggs, keeping the yolks runny. (Traditional bibimbap is often served with a raw egg.)</p>\n<h4>Alternative #1</h4>\n<p>Assemble each bowl: rice first, then arrange the protein and vegetables, and top with a fried egg. </p>\n<h4>Alternative #2</h4>\n<p>Assemble everything in a small cast iron skillet, similar to what one would do with the traditional stone bowls, and toast the rice for about 5 minutes.</p>\n<h4>Final step</h4>\n<p>Top with a generous sprinkling of roasted sesame seeds. </p>\n<p>Variation: Top with a bit of crushed roasted seaweed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bibimbap","date":"December 12, 2020","description":"This Korean comfort food is more forgiving and less trouble than it looks.","prep":"20 mins","cook":"30 mins","servings":"2","tags":["Main","Korean"],"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"protein: meat or tofu","note":null},{"ingredient":"carrot (julienned), some spinach","note":"enough for 2 people"},{"ingredient":"mushrooms, red pepper, bean sprouts","note":"these are suggestions, use whatever you have"},{"ingredient":"2 eggs","note":null},{"ingredient":"2 servings of cooked rice","note":null},{"ingredient":"1-2 Tbsp gochujang","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 Tbsp sesame oil","note":null},{"ingredient":"pinch of sugar","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 tsp vinegar (e.g., rice vinegar, apple cider vinegar)","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 clove garlic, minced","note":null},{"ingredient":"roasted sesame seeds","note":null}],"tools":null,"suggestions":null,"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/0ff54/full.jpg 1200w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/06655/full.jpg 1600w,\n/static/8fe3940ec037efee45d6b00e8bb9ad05/5f7bf/full.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bibimbap/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/rice-waffles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Norwegian Rice Waffles"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
