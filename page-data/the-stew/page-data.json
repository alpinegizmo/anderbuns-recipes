You can peel the ginger with a spoon, but no one will notice if you don’t bother. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the onion begins to brown a little.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: 8-10 minutes</h4>\n<p>Add the turmeric, red-pepper flakes, and chickpeas. Season again with salt and pepper. Stir frequently, so that the chickpeas fry in the oil and spices. You want them to eventually break down (in the next step), but for now, let them get a bit crispy.</p>\n<h4>Step 3: 30 minutes</h4>\n<p>Crush the chickpeas. Add the coconut milk and stock (or water), and season again with salt and pepper. Let it simmer.</p>\n<h4>Step 4: a few minutes</h4>\n<p>Add the greens, wait for them to wilt and soften, which won’t take long.</p>\n<h4>Step 5: you’re done!</h4>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spiced Chickpea Stew with Coconut and Turmeric","date":"December 13, 2020","description":"Aka \"The Stew\"","prep":"10 mins","cook":"50 mins","servings":"4-6","tags":["Vegan(ish)","Indian"],"tools":[{"name":"a large pot","note":null},{"name":"a wooden spoon or other implement for smashing the chickpeas in step 3","note":null}],"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"¼ cup olive oil","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 large yellow onion, chopped","note":null},{"ingredient":"2 garlic cloves","note":"4, if you dare"},{"ingredient":"1 (2-inch) piece ginger, finely chopped","note":null},{"ingredient":"salt and pepper","note":null},{"ingredient":"1½ tsp ground turmeric","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 tsp red-pepper flakes","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 large can of chickpeas","note":null},{"ingredient":"2 (15-ounce) cans coconut milk","note":"yes, that's a lot. you could use 1½ cans and add more water"},{"ingredient":"2 cups of stock","note":"or water"},{"ingredient":"1 bunch of greens: Swiss chard, kale, ...","note":"charred endives are terrific here, spinach is boring"}],"sauce":null,"suggestions":[{"ingredient":"lemon or lime wedges","note":null},{"ingredient":"mint leaves","note":null},{"ingredient":"yogurt","note":null},{"ingredient":"flat bread","note":null}],"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-66ece93cc49ac414e919d6f712a9c6e1.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/66ece93cc49ac414e919d6f712a9c6e1/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/66ece93cc49ac414e919d6f712a9c6e1/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/66ece93cc49ac414e919d6f712a9c6e1/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/66ece93cc49ac414e919d6f712a9c6e1/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/66ece93cc49ac414e919d6f712a9c6e1/89732/full.jpg 1196w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-stew/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/mapo-tofu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mapo Tofu"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gochujang-stew/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gochujang Stew"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
