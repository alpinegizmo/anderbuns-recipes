Don’t remove the core — you want to keep it so that the wedges remain intact.</p>\n<p>I use a mixture of oil and butter, and turn the wedges over once they are nicely charred on one side. You can baste the cabbage as it cooks with the hot oil/butter mixture.</p>\n<p>Haven’t tried this yet with the vinegar, fish sauce, and tarragon (from the video below), but I like the idea very much. I have tried fresh basil, and that was good.</p>\n<h4>References</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DSIRwSqXv6w\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackened-cabbage-with-kelp-brown-butter\">https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackened-cabbage-with-kelp-brown-butter</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Charred Cabbage","date":"December 15, 2020","description":"Burnt is beautiful","prep":"3 mins","cook":"15 mins","servings":"4","tags":["Side","Vegan(ish)"],"tools":null,"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"head of cabbage, something like a savoy","note":null},{"ingredient":"1-2 Tbsp grapeseed oil","note":null},{"ingredient":"2-4 Tbsp butter","note":null},{"ingredient":"splash of vinegar","note":null},{"ingredient":"splash of fish sauce","note":null},{"ingredient":"chopped tarragon","note":null},{"ingredient":"salt and pepper","note":null}],"sauce":null,"suggestions":null,"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-da099a3fa0718549139f6992100bd73f.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/da099a3fa0718549139f6992100bd73f/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/da099a3fa0718549139f6992100bd73f/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/da099a3fa0718549139f6992100bd73f/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/da099a3fa0718549139f6992100bd73f/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/da099a3fa0718549139f6992100bd73f/0ff54/full.jpg 1200w,\n/static/da099a3fa0718549139f6992100bd73f/06655/full.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/charred-cabbage/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/saag-feta/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Saag Feta"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
