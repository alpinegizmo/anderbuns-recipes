Yields 10-12 large pancakes. This recipe scales up and down reasonably well (if you cut the recipe in half, the extra egg isn’t a problem).</p>\n<p>Whisk together the dry ingredients, then add the wet to the dry. Do not overwork the batter; you don’t want to develop the gluten. Don’t worry about having some lumps, they’ll disappear during cooking.</p>\n<p>The popular notion that “the first pancake is always spoiled” is only true if you aren’t familiar with the pan and the stove. Once you know what you’re doing, you can get it right every time. Just make sure the pan is hot before you pour on the batter. A droplet of water should skeeter across the pan: if it sits there, the pan is too cold, if it evaporates instantly, it’s too hot.</p>\n<p>A pancake is ready to flip over when it starts to firm up around the rim, and the bubbles that form stick around after they pop.</p>\n<p>For miso maple butter, see <a href=\"https://www.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/miso-maple-butter-recipe\">Miso Maple Butter Is the Condiment You Have Been Missing Your Entire Life</a>.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Variations</h3>\n<h4>Yamcakes</h4>\n<p>Microwave a yam while mixing up the batter. Moosh up half of the yam (unless it’s rather small), and add that to the batter.</p>\n<h4>Oatmeal</h4>\n<p>Replace ½ cup of flour with 1 cup of oatmeal. If you’re using whole oats, soak them in the buttermilk first, preferably overnight.</p>\n<h4>Blueberries</h4>\n<p>I prefer to place the blueberries into each pancake by hand right after pouring out the batter, especially if the berries are frozen. But you can mix them into the batter.</p>\n<h4>Whole wheat flour</h4>\n<p>Don’t replace all of the white flour with whole wheat, use a mixture.</p>\n<p>Same goes for masa; it’s good in pancakes, but keep some of the regular flour.</p>\n<p>Spelt flour is great, but you won’t really notice the difference.</p>\n<h4>Buckwheat?</h4>\n<p>No, don’t care for it. Didn’t like rye flour either, the one time we tried it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Buttermilk Pancakes","date":"December 13, 2020","description":"The only thing I've made more than 1000 times.","prep":"10 mins","cook":"20 mins","servings":"3","tags":["Breakfast"],"tools":[{"name":"whisk","note":null}],"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"1½ cups flour","note":null},{"ingredient":"½ tsp baking powder","note":null},{"ingredient":"¾ tsp baking soda","note":null},{"ingredient":"½ tsp salt","note":null},{"ingredient":"3 Tbsp vegetable oil","note":"I never measure this, I just think \"glug, glug, glug\"."},{"ingredient":"2 cups buttermilk","note":"in a pinch you can make do with yogurt or with 2 Tbsp of vinegar mixed into 2 cups of milk"},{"ingredient":"1 egg","note":null}],"sauce":null,"suggestions":[{"ingredient":"miso maple butter","note":null},{"ingredient":"nuts, berries, banana slices","note":null}],"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-749d383d6aff243e2dcd6b13eaffb335.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/749d383d6aff243e2dcd6b13eaffb335/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/749d383d6aff243e2dcd6b13eaffb335/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/749d383d6aff243e2dcd6b13eaffb335/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/749d383d6aff243e2dcd6b13eaffb335/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/749d383d6aff243e2dcd6b13eaffb335/960ec/full.jpg 819w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pancakes/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bibimbap/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bibimbap"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/rye-tahini-chocolate-cookies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rye Tahini Chocolate Cookies"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
