I’ve tried others; this one is easier, and I’ve never messed it up.</p>\n<h4>Step 1: Start noodles</h4>\n<p>Cover noodles with boiling water, let them sit until barely tender. Drain, and put some peanut oil on them to keep them from sticking together. Set them aside until ready to add at the end.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Make sauce</h4>\n<p>Meanwhile, cook together the tamarind paste, fish sauce (unless vegan), honey, and vinegar in a small saucepan. Bring it to a simmer, check the flavor. Maybe add more tamarind paste, but don’t make it too sour. Stir in red pepper flakes and turn off the heat.</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Stir fry the main ingredients</h4>\n<p>Heat up 3 Tbsp of peanut oil in a large skillet or wok (medium-high heat), then add scallions and garlic. After a minute add the eggs; once they start to set, scramble then until barely done. Add cabbage and sprouts, then protein(s). </p>\n<h4>Step 4: Put it all together</h4>\n<p>Add the drained noodles and the sauce to the pan, heat the noodles through and serve with peanuts, cilantro, and lime wedges.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pad Thai","date":"December 20, 2020","description":"Foolproof pad thai","prep":"5 mins","cook":"25 mins","servings":"4","tags":["Main","Thai","Vegan(ish)"],"tools":null,"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"package of wide rice noodles","note":null},{"ingredient":"¼ cup peanut oil","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 Tbsp tamarind paste","note":null},{"ingredient":"¼ cup fish sauce (nam pla)","note":null},{"ingredient":"⅓ cup honey","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 Tbsp rice vinegar","note":null},{"ingredient":"½ tsp red pepper flakes (to taste)","note":null},{"ingredient":"¼ cup chopped scallions","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 garlic clove (minced)","note":null},{"ingredient":"2 eggs","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 small Napa cabbage (shredded)","note":"about 4 cups"},{"ingredient":"1 cup bean sprouts","note":null},{"ingredient":"½ lb peeled shrimp or pressed tofu","note":null}],"sauce":null,"suggestions":[{"ingredient":"½ cup roasted peanuts","note":null},{"ingredient":"¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro","note":null},{"ingredient":"lime wedges","note":null}],"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-0ba0f0e67aabe45148e8e11c0f081918.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQD/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFUlcop6pH/xAAbEAACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBAADERMUNP/aAAgBAQABBQJrzqA9EZOKFb9l8//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQIf/aAAgBAwEBPwEcn//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ/9oACAECAQE/AWf/xAAaEAABBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIQETFR/9oACAEBAAY/AnobkOPEBVR//8QAGxAAAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQABEEExYaH/2gAIAQEAAT8h4kQgCzGjxTtfPcf/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEF/P/8QAGBEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARARUbH/2gAIAQMBAT8QYoO8j//EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQESH/2gAIAQIBAT8QDbF//8QAGhABAQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAITEQUf/aAAgBAQABPxBopbPO9MbDilUNa819UI+xM0+B2Vdef//Z","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/0ba0f0e67aabe45148e8e11c0f081918/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0ba0f0e67aabe45148e8e11c0f081918/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/0ba0f0e67aabe45148e8e11c0f081918/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/0ba0f0e67aabe45148e8e11c0f081918/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/0ba0f0e67aabe45148e8e11c0f081918/0ff54/full.jpg 1200w,\n/static/0ba0f0e67aabe45148e8e11c0f081918/06655/full.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pad-thai/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/thai-peanut-sauce/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thai Peanut Sauce"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hummus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hummus"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
