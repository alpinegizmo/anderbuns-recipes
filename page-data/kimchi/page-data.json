Dunk the halves in a large bowl of water to moisten all the leaves. Place on a work surface. Sprinkle the salt between the leaves and put the cabbage in a large bowl. Let stand for 1½ hours, turning the cabbage over every 30 minutes.</p>\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<p>Meanwhile, combine the rice flour and water in a saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until it bubbles, about 10 minutes. Add the sugar and cook, stirring, until the porridge is a little translucent and thinner, a few more minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.</p>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<p>Rinse the cabbage halves under cold running water, ruffling the leaves to remove any dirt and the excess salt. Split each half lengthwise into 2 pieces. Drain well.</p>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<p>Prepare the kimchi paste: Put the cooled porridge, garlic, ginger, shiso, fish sauce, hot pepper flakes, radish, scallions, and chives in a large bowl. Mix well. </p>\n<h4>Step 5</h4>\n<p>Leaving the cabbage quarters intact, spread some kimchi paste over each leaf. Pack the cabbage quarters into the four Mason jars or other airtight containers and cover. Leave a little bit of “head room” to allow for fermentation.</p>\n<h4>Step 6</h4>\n<p>Let stand at cool room temperature. Once the kimchi has condensed sufficiently (~1 day), combine kimchi into 2 jars. Burp kimchi every 12ish hours and taste until the kimchi smells and tastes sour, 1 to 2 days (depending on ambient temperature). Move to refrigerator. </p>\n<h4>Serve</h4>\n<p>Serve by cutting kimchi with kitchen scissors and removing cut pieces from jar.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kimchi","date":"January 01, 2021","description":"Adapation from Maangchi's kimchi recipe.
