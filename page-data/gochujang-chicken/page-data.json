Grate or mince a couple of garlic cloves, and add that to the gochujang oil. Do the same with the ginger.</p>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<p>Cut what’s left of the head of garlic in half, and put one half of it inside the bird.</p>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<p>Somehow coat the chicken with roughly half of the gochujang oil. If you have a pastry brush, this is a good time to use it. Reserve some of the gochujang oil to put on the veggies.</p>\n<h4>Step 5</h4>\n<p>Decide if you want more than just potatoes: adding a couple of carrots and some cauliflower florets is a fine thing. Chop the veggies into medium-sized chunks (you want them small enough that they have plenty of surface area exposed to the sauce).</p>\n<p>Arrange the veggies around the outside of your skillet, and plop the chicken down in the middle, right on top of the remaining garlic. You want the garlic to bathe in the rendered chicken fat, and then spread its garlicky goodness to the veggies.</p>\n<p>Coat all these veggies with a mixture of the remaining gochujang oil, plus the extra 2 Tbsp of oil. Season with some salt and pepper.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/d2602/before.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"ready to go in the oven\"\n        title=\"ready to go in the oven\"\n        src=\"/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/1c72d/before.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/a80bd/before.jpg 148w,\n/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/1c91a/before.jpg 295w,\n/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/1c72d/before.jpg 590w,\n/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/a8a14/before.jpg 885w,\n/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/fbd2c/before.jpg 1180w,\n/static/8431fa1444c3327a559f4e211f890932/d2602/before.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h4>Step 6</h4>\n<p>Slow-roast this until the potatoes are really tender and the chicken skin is a deep reddish-golden brown, 2½-3 hours. You might want to turn the potatoes and other veggies at some point so they are nicely coated in the oily juices that will accumulate in the pan.</p>\n<p>When it’s done, the legs should be loose, and the chicken should basically fall apart.</p>\n<p>Once out of the oven, let everything rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting into the chicken. This will keep the juices in the meat.</p>\n<h4>Step 7</h4>\n<p>The scallions, limes, and honey are for dressing things up, if you want. We usually skip the honey, and never have enough scallions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Slow-Roasted Gochujang Chicken","date":"December 25, 2020","description":"An instant favorite.","prep":"1 hour","cook":"2½-3 hours","servings":"4","tags":["Main","Korean"],"tools":[{"name":"14-inch cast iron skillet (or something large enough to roast a whole chicken plus veggies)","note":null},{"name":"pastry brush (or your hands)","note":null},{"name":"whisk (or a fork)","note":null},{"name":"microplane grater (or a knife)","note":null}],"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"whole chicken","note":null},{"ingredient":"salt and pepper","note":null},{"ingredient":"5 Tbsp gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)","note":null},{"ingredient":"¼ cup plus 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 head of garlic","note":"original recipe calls for 2 heads"},{"ingredient":"1½ inches of fresh ginger","note":null},{"ingredient":"1½ pound small potatoes","note":"we like to add some carrot and cauliflower"}],"sauce":null,"suggestions":[{"ingredient":"scallions","note":null},{"ingredient":"limes","note":null},{"ingredient":"honey","note":null}],"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHOoW4HmEll/8QAGhABAQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEAEQMhIv/aAAgBAQABBQIGa0bHx0ULzqE9rP/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESH/2gAIAQMBAT8BUhh//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAx/9oACAECAQE/AXYG/8QAGBAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEREjH/2gAIAQEABj8C0xWE6jNkG6U//8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAITFBUXH/2gAIAQEAAT8hrZ8GoVtfkRRZYMcI5J9lgkMBCM7Gf//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQwz//xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREh/9oACAEDAQE/EJUN1h//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEh/9oACAECAQE/EEtF2UdZ/8QAGhAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAIVExkf/aAAgBAQABPxDVghbQdJg8DHDo7WSgIUnUbH0U00e8hZCIkQr0mEojaAwT/9k=","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1/0ff54/full.jpg 1200w,\n/static/fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1/06655/full.jpg 1600w,\n/static/fbd9d0c1a4d83324223ae4c69e2930f1/5f7bf/full.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gochujang-chicken/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/apple-pie/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Apple Pie"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
