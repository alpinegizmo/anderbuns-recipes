Grate or mince a couple of garlic cloves, and add that to the gochujang oil. Do the same with the ginger.</p>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<p>Cut what’s left of the head of garlic in half, and put one half of it inside the bird.</p>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<p>Somehow coat the chicken with roughly half of the gochujang oil. If you have a pastry brush, this is a good time to use it. Reserve some of the gochujang oil to put on the veggies.</p>\n<h4>Step 5</h4>\n<p>Decide if you want more than just potatoes: adding a carrot or two, and/or some onion, is a fine thing. Roughly chop the carrot(s), onion, and potatoes if they’re too large, and add in the remaining garlic. Then coat all these veggies with a mixture of the remaining gochujang oil, plus the extra 2 Tbsp of oil. Season with some salt and pepper, give it all a toss to combine.</p>\n<h4>Step 6</h4>\n<p>Arrange the veggies around the outside of your skillet, and plop the chicken down in the middle, right on top of the garlic.</p>\n<h4>Step 7</h4>\n<p>Slow-roast this util the potatoes are really tender and the chicken skin is a deep reddish-golden brown, 2½-3 hours. You might want to turn the potatoes and other veggies once or twice so they are nicely coated in the oily juices that will accumulate in the pan.</p>\n<p>When it’s done, the legs should be loose, and the chicken should basically fall apart.</p>\n<p>Once out of the oven, let everything rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting into the chicken. This will keep the juices in the meat.</p>\n<h4>Step 8</h4>\n<p>The scallions, limes, and honey are for dressing things up, if you want. We usually skip the honey, and never have enough scallions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Slow-Roasted Gochujang Chicken","date":"December 12, 2020","description":"An instant favorite.","prep":"20-30 mins","cook":"2½-3 hours","servings":"4","tags":["Main","Korean"],"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"whole chicken","note":null},{"ingredient":"salt and pepper","note":null},{"ingredient":"5 Tbsp gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)","note":null},{"ingredient":"¼ cup plus 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 head of garlic","note":"original recipe calls for 2 heads"},{"ingredient":"1½ inches of fresh ginger","note":null},{"ingredient":"1½ pound small potatoes","note":"we like to add some carrot and onion"}],"tools":[{"name":"14-inch cast iron skillet (or something large enough to roast a whole chicken plus veggies)"},{"name":"pastry brush (or your hands)"},{"name":"whisk (or a fork)"},{"name":"microplane grater (or a knife)"}],"suggestions":[{"ingredient":"5 scallions"},{"ingredient":"2 limes"},{"ingredient":"2 tsp honey"}],"full_img":{"publicURL":"/chez-nosredna/static/full-4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/chez-nosredna/static/4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/chez-nosredna/static/4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/chez-nosredna/static/4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/chez-nosredna/static/4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/chez-nosredna/static/4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc/0ff54/full.jpg 1200w,\n/chez-nosredna/static/4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc/06655/full.jpg 1600w,\n/chez-nosredna/static/4bca92b94bf687a461bdd3990698a2cc/5f7bf/full.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gochujang-chicken/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/papas-chorreadas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Papas Chorreadas"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
