Ehh.)</p>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<p>Add the tomatoes and salt, and give everything a nice stir from time to time.</p>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<p>At some point the potatoes will be done, and you can switch to steaming the green beans in the microwave (if you didn’t steam both veggies on the stove). </p>\n<p>Add the potatoes and green beans to the skillet as they become ready.
