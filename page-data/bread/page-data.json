It’s not that you have to work the dough, but any flour that doesn’t get wet now will become a regret later on. You can just leave it in the bowl you mixed it in, covered with plastic wrap.</li>\n<li>Don’t skimp on the rising time. Plan on 16-18 hours for the first rise.</li>\n<li>Before you turn on the oven, take the dough and do a few stretch/fold maneuvers (and don’t worry if it’s a shaggy blob). This involves stretching the dough out in one dimension, enough to then fold it over in thirds. Then rotate 90°, and repeat. Do about four of these stretches and folds, and then shape and pinch the blob into a loaf as best you can, putting the seam down onto parchment paper. Cover again and let it rest for about two hours. I’ve found covering it with a towel makes a mess, so I suggest transfering it back into the mixing bowl.</li>\n<li>With both of these rises, it’s not really about waiting for a preset about of time, but rather waiting until the dough has reached the right stage of readiness. You’ll learn to recognize this.</li>\n<li>Pre-heat the oven to 450°F (around 230°C), with the dutch oven in the oven (which is why you didn’t put the shaggy blob into the dutch oven earlier — you’d rather not have to move it an extra time). You can start this about 30 minutes before the second rise is done, as it will take your oven a while to heat up. (Part of what’s happening during this second rise is that the blob is developing a tougher “skin” that will hold the loaf together, and allow the gas inside to expand, while holding it in.)</li>\n<li>When it’s time to bake, you’ll have to <em>carefully</em> take the hot dutch oven out of the oven.</li>\n<li>You can use the parchment paper to lift the proto-loaf and ferry it into the dutch oven like a helicopter. But you’ll probably want to reshape it somewhat first.</li>\n<li>When you take the lid off after the first 30 minutes of baking, you can remove the parchment paper, if you want.</li>\n<li>Slash the loaf with a knife before baking. This isn’t just about making it pretty — it reduces the surface tension of the loaf, and helps it open up while baking.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"No Knead Bread","date":"December 13, 2020","description":"An internet classic","prep":"18 hours","cook":"45 mins","servings":"1 loaf","tags":["Vegan(ish)","Bread"],"tools":[{"name":"dutch oven","note":"We use a pyrex caserole dish with a lid."},{"name":"parchment paper","note":null}],"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"3 cups all-purpose flour","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 ¾ tsp salt","note":null},{"ingredient":"½ tsp active dry yeast","note":null},{"ingredient":"1 ½ cups water room temperature","note":null}],"sauce":null,"suggestions":null,"full_img":{"publicURL":"/static/full-90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f/2f1b1/full.jpg","srcSet":"/static/90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f/fd013/full.jpg 200w,\n/static/90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f/25252/full.jpg 400w,\n/static/90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f/2f1b1/full.jpg 800w,\n/static/90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f/0ff54/full.jpg 1200w,\n/static/90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f/06655/full.jpg 1600w,\n/static/90e80cd66e23ae5a15b26b7166b7f90f/5f7bf/full.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bread/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/rye-tahini-chocolate-cookies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rye Tahini Chocolate Cookies"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tuna-moosh/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tuna Moosh"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
